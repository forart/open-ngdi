# Uses of this Project #

  * Archival digitization of priceless deteriorating audio in maximum possible quality, for later interpretation (With this goal 6-bit 512fs 24.576Mhz no longer seems inefficient, as file size is irrelevant for archival purposes).
  * Encoding/Decoding Data over Radio, either for ham use, or for developing radio protocols. In combination with a SDR (software defined radio) project a high quality ADC/DAC interface greatly increases it's utility.
  * Psycho-acoustic research always can use a higher quality sound recording interface. With High speed Delta-Sigma the slightest phase shifts can be detected or created, with much finer time shifts possible than traditional PCM formats.
  * Radio Astronomy could definitely find a use for a cheap common high quality interface, using techniques such as aperture synthesis, using the internet to connect data among many amatuers.
  * MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar), SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) technologies can all benefit from more accurate digitization. Open source projects like these are needed for the developing world and researchers alike, and there development would spawn a new era in study and growth in multiple fields of science.
  * By giving the opensource hardware community a new and cutting edge interface will spawn new projects not imagined before, maybe not possible with existing available public domain technologies. Anything that helps amateurs and researchers in opening new possibilities is beneficial to moving humanity forward. Like all opensource projects this is done for mainly altruistic purposes.

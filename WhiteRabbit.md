# Introduction #
The WhiteRabbit Network technology was developed at CERN and released on the [CERN Open Hardware Repository website](http://www.ohwr.org) under the CERN-OHL v1.2 (CERN Open-Hardware License).

The WhiteRabbit Network system could very easily become the backbone of many projects requiring high speed data to be transmitted from multiple sources with great fidelity over large areas. Sub-nanosecond fidelity of synchronization of packets over facilities as large as 10km is reported, and more than 1000 nodes can communicate seamlessly, these impressive numbers are a necessity at a facility like CERN, but for most cases is generous overhead. This should not limit this technology to only very large high end facilities, with generous overhead any facility using this standard will have room to expand, and a robust system capable of dealing with large amounts of data.

Active:

**OpenNGADC - Open Next-Gen Analog to Digital Converter, high precision and achieving maximum attainable specifications are the primary goals. No analog stages, all supplies either external or by-passable.**

Proposed:

**OpenNGPSU - Open Next-Gen Power Supply Unit - power supply needs development, has uses with many projects.**

**OpenNGSR - Open Next-Gen Super Regulator, needed by many projects, we all need an open super regulator! The more people working on it the better for everyone.**

**OpenLVDS - Open LVDS - make a standard LVDS-I2S bridge. Don't we all need a real standard in the world for this? either based on HDMI or ethernet.**

**OpenDSD - Open Delta-Sigma Driver - maybe a standard cross-platform Delta-Sigma driver could be developed and embraced by manufacturers, this would be a great help to the general acceptance and implementation of Delta-Sigma audio.**

This project really aims to take on multiple fields where open hardware is lacking. These projects all aim to have many uses across many fields.

The whole concept of open development (to me) is not just to stop reinventing the wheel, but to move forward and work together as a society on common goals.
